# Compatibility & versioning

## Runtime requirement

mex 0.7.0 requires Node.js 22.5 or newer. The code graph uses the built-in `node:sqlite` module; older Node releases are unsupported. Users who cannot upgrade Node can remain on mex v0.6.3, which supports Node.js 20 or newer.

This document defines `mex-agent`'s public contract: what's stable, what isn't,
and what counts as a breaking change. It is intended for embedders — tools that
depend on `mex-agent` as a library — and for `mex-agent` maintainers when
shipping new versions.

If you only use the `mex` CLI, most of this still applies, but CLI flags
themselves are best-effort (see [CLI surface](#cli-surface) below).

## The public API

The only public surface is what's exported from the package entry point:

```ts
import { /* … */ } from "mex-agent";
```

Concretely, that's everything re-exported from
[`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts):

- **Functions** — `findConfig`, `createConfig`, `appendEvent`, `readEvents`,
  `eventLogPath`, `runDriftCheck`, `parseFrontmatter`, `checkHeartbeat`,
  `runHeartbeat`.
- **Graph retrieval functions** — `runGraphScope`, `runGraphGet`,
  `runGraphQuery`, `runImpact`. See
  [Graph retrieval](#graph-retrieval) for the precise boundary.
- **Runtime constants** — `EVENT_KINDS`, `DEFAULT_STALENESS_THRESHOLDS`,
  `DEFAULT_SCAFFOLD_PATTERNS`, `DEFAULT_HEARTBEAT_PATTERNS`,
  `DEFAULT_RETRIEVAL_OPTIONS`.
- **Types** — `MexConfig`, `CreateConfigInput`, `EventEntry`, `EventKind`,
  `LogOpts`, `DriftReport`, `DriftIssue`, `RunDriftCheckOpts`,
  `HeartbeatResult`, `HeartbeatOpts`, `CheckHeartbeatOpts`,
  `StalenessThresholds`, `WatchConfig`, `HeartbeatConfig`, `AiTool`,
  `IssueCode`, `Severity`, `ScaffoldFrontmatter`, `FrontmatterEdge`, `Claim`,
  `ClaimKind`, `AgentCommandDeps`, `AgentOptions`, `DetailLevel`.

The CI smoke test at [`test/public-api.test.ts`](./test/public-api.test.ts)
asserts the existence and basic shape of these exports. Any change that breaks
that test is a breaking change.

## What is NOT public

Everything else. Specifically:

- All internal modules — `src/cli.ts`, `src/sync/`, `src/scanner/`,
  `src/setup/`, `src/tui.ts`, `src/watch.ts`, `src/doctor.ts`, `src/graph/`,
  and any other path not re-exported from `src/index.ts`. The graph retrieval
  operations re-exported from `src/index.ts` are the sole exception — see
  [Graph retrieval](#graph-retrieval).
- Deep imports such as `mex-agent/dist/internal.js` — the `exports` field in
  `package.json` blocks these, and they may break without notice.
- The on-disk format of internal files such as the scaffold `config.json`. Use
  the documented helpers to read and write them.

## Semver policy

`mex-agent` follows [semver](https://semver.org/) with this interpretation:

| Change                                                | Type  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Adding a new export                                   | minor |
| Adding an optional parameter to a public function     | minor |
| Adding an optional field to a public interface        | minor |
| Widening accepted input types                         | minor |
| Bug fix preserving documented behaviour               | patch |
| Internal refactor not visible from outside            | patch |
| Removing a public export                              | major |
| Renaming a public export                              | major |
| Changing a function signature (required parameters)   | major |
| Narrowing a return type or required field             | major |
| Removing a field from a public interface              | major |

While the package is on `0.x` (pre-1.0), breaking changes may ship in minor
versions, but they will still be flagged as breaking — surfaced in the
changelog, with a deprecation note where possible and migration guidance in the
PR description.

## "Soft" parts of the public API

Two exports are public *in name* but not in *contents*:

- **`DEFAULT_SCAFFOLD_PATTERNS`** — the constant continues to exist and to be
  exported, but new entries may be added in any minor version. Embedders that
  need exact behaviour should pass `scaffoldPatterns` explicitly to
  `runDriftCheck`.
- **`DEFAULT_HEARTBEAT_PATTERNS`** — same policy. Pass `scaffoldPatterns`
  explicitly to `checkHeartbeat` / `runHeartbeat` if exact behaviour matters.

These constants are exported so embedders can extend the defaults
(`[...DEFAULT_SCAFFOLD_PATTERNS, "traces/**/*.md"]`) rather than re-typing the
list. They are not a contract on the list's contents.

## Graph retrieval

Four retrieval operations are public: `runGraphScope`, `runGraphGet`,
`runGraphQuery`, and `runImpact`. They exist as public exports because the MCP
server ships as a separate package (`packages/mex-mcp`) and can reach
`mex-agent` only through this entry point; compact, budgeted retrieval is worth
a stable contract.

The contract covers:

- The four functions, their parameter order, and their streaming shape. Each is
  synchronous, returns `void`, and emits one newline-delimited JSON record per
  `write` call.
- **`AgentCommandDeps.write`** — the seam that captures the JSONL stream.
  `write` defaults to `console.log`; a host whose stdout carries a protocol
  (an MCP stdio server, for instance) **must** pass its own `write`.
- The `AgentOptions` field names — `detail`, `maxNodes`, `maxOutputTokens`,
  `maxSourceLines`, `depth`, `fingerprint` — and `DEFAULT_RETRIEVAL_OPTIONS` as
  a base to spread from. `maxOutputTokens` is enforced *while* records are
  emitted, so a response is truncated rather than allowed to exceed it.
- The emitted record `type` values (`meta`, `fact`, `edge`, `source`, `result`,
  `target`, `defines`, `caller`, `grounding`, `error`, `summary`), the
  `schemaVersion` field on `meta`, and the error `code` values. `meta` is
  always first and `summary` always last.

The contract does **not** cover anything that produces those records. The graph
engine, tree-sitter extraction, symbol resolution, fingerprint reconciliation,
and `schema.sql` remain internal, as does every other module under
`src/graph/`. The public surface names *operations*, not implementations: no
way to construct, mutate, or introspect a graph became public.

Bumping `schemaVersion` is a breaking change and is surfaced as one.

## Scaffold-directory ownership

### Code-node grounding

Scaffold frontmatter may include an optional `grounds_to` array. Each entry stores a graph node id and serialized fingerprint:

```yaml
grounds_to:
  - node: "function:a3f8...c21"
    fingerprint: "mh:64:9f2a..."
```

Files without `grounds_to` retain their previous behavior. The graph database and grounding baselines under `.mex/` are internal mex data and should not be edited directly.

The `LanguageExtractor` and `FrameworkResolver` interfaces are source-level contribution seams, not part of the public npm API, and may change between minor versions. They are intentionally not exported from `src/index.ts`. See [Graph retrieval](#graph-retrieval) for the narrow set of graph *operations* that are public.

Inside the `.mex/` scaffold directory, some paths are owned by `mex-agent`
itself, and some are reserved for embedders.

### Owned by mex (mex writes, scans, or manages these)

- `ROUTER.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SETUP.md`, `SYNC.md` — top-level scaffold files.
- `context/*.md` — context documents (scanned by drift checkers).
- `patterns/*.md` — pattern documents (scanned by drift checkers).
- `events/decisions.jsonl` — append-only event log.
- `config.json` — persisted scaffold configuration.
- `graph.db` (plus SQLite sidecar files) — generated code graph, fingerprints, and grounding baselines.

Embedders should not write to these paths.

### Reserved for embedders

These paths are not scanned by default checkers and `mex-agent` will not write
to them. Embedders may use them freely:

- `.mex/traces/**` — long-form decision traces.
- `.mex/failures/**` — failure / postmortem records.

Other paths under `.mex/` are unclaimed. If you're an embedder and need a new
namespace, open an issue first — `mex-agent` may add features later that
conflict otherwise.

## CLI surface

The `mex` CLI ships in the package, but its flag and subcommand surface is
**best-effort, not contract-bound**. The CLI is a thin wrapper over the
programmatic API; embedders should consume the programmatic API directly
rather than shell out.

If you need a CLI flag to remain stable, file an issue requesting it be
promoted to the public contract.

## Deprecation policy

When a public export is going to be removed:

1. It is marked `@deprecated` in JSDoc and noted in the changelog.
2. It remains functional for **at least one minor version** with the
   deprecation warning in place.
3. The next major version removes it.

Concrete example: if `foo` is deprecated in 0.7.0, it still works in 0.7.x. It
may be removed in 0.8.0 or 1.0.0.

## Reporting compatibility issues
