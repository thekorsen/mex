# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Graph retrieval over MCP** — `packages/mex-mcp` gains `mex_graph_scope`, `mex_graph_get`, `mex_graph_query`, and `mex_impact`, bringing the retrieval surface that was previously CLI-only to MCP clients as first-class tool calls. Each takes an optional `projectRoot` like the existing five tools, returns the same newline-delimited `meta`/`fact`/`edge`/`source`/`summary` records the CLI emits (`schemaVersion` 1), and keeps the token budget exposed and defaulted — `tokenBudget` (1500) on scope/query/impact, `maxOutputTokens` on get — enforced while emitting, so output is bounded rather than truncated after the fact. A missing graph returns a structured `GRAPH_UNAVAILABLE` record, never a stack trace. [#10](https://github.com/thekorsen/mex/issues/10)
- The four graph retrieval operations are now part of the public API: `runGraphScope`, `runGraphGet`, `runGraphQuery`, `runImpact`, plus `DEFAULT_RETRIEVAL_OPTIONS` and the `AgentCommandDeps`, `AgentOptions`, and `DetailLevel` types. This was a deliberate widening — `mex-mcp` is a separate package and can only reach `mex-agent` through its `exports` map, so the alternative was shelling out to the CLI. Everything else under `src/graph/` remains internal; see COMPATIBILITY.md.

### Fixed
- Process-global state in the long-lived MCP server no longer leaks across `projectRoot`s. The `SimpleGit` handle is keyed per repository root instead of being a singleton, and the graph nudge flags are tracked per project root instead of once per process — previously the first repo checked suppressed the "run `mex graph`" nudge for every other repo for the process lifetime. [#11](https://github.com/thekorsen/mex/issues/11)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- Deterministic local SQLite code graph for TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, JSX, Python, and Rust, including cross-file resolution, body hashes, MinHash fingerprints, and LSH reconciliation.
- Twelfth drift checker for `grounds_to` code-node grounding, with drift, gone, ambiguous, and durable moved-node repair behavior.
- Inline `mex://<node-id>` anchors for navigable symbol mentions, including warning-only drift detection and durable sync repair.
- `mex graph`, `mex graph scope`, `mex graph query`, `mex graph get`, and `mex impact` commands for graph building, compact task-neighborhood retrieval, structural lookup, targeted source expansion, and blast-radius analysis.
- `mex graph ground` for idempotently retro-grounding populated pre-0.7 scaffolds while preserving their prose.
- Express reference resolver that links route registrations to handler nodes.
- Fresh setup now builds and consumes the graph, authors tight `grounds_to` entries and load-bearing inline anchors, and captures grounding baselines immediately.
- A deterministic JSONL agent protocol with explicit detail levels, scored selection reasons, stable ordering, node quotas, and a hard estimated-output-token ceiling.
- Reproducible retrieval and agent evaluation harnesses under `evaluate/`.

### Changed
- Minimum Node.js version is now 22.5 because the graph uses the built-in `node:sqlite` module.
- The mex repository's own scaffold moved from the legacy root layout into `.mex/`; published user scaffolds continue to come from `templates/`.
- Agent tool-config templates now explain graph queries, impact analysis, and ambiguous-grounding adjudication.
- Setup, migration, and sync follow “read broad, ground tight”: broad context stays sparse while behavioral patterns ground to the specific implementing symbols.
- Sync repairs prose and refreshes both frontmatter grounding and inline anchors after body drift, moves, deletions, or ambiguous reconciliation.
- Telemetry delivery failures are silent so offline analytics cannot pollute JSON or JSONL command output.
- Agent retrieval defaults to compact `minimal` facts; source is opt-in through `--detail source` or fetched for exact node ids with `mex graph get`.
- The direct `glob` dependency is updated to v13, with patched minimatch and brace-expansion transitive releases.

### Fixed
- External-content FTS5 indexing remains consistent across duplicate node ids and clean installed-package builds, preventing graph-build corruption seen during real setup testing.
- Grounding baselines are captured after setup and migration as well as sync, so the first post-authoring body edit emits `GROUNDING_DRIFT` without a hand-seeded snapshot.
- Retrieval output now enforces its configured budget while emitting, avoids over-expanding broad symbols, and remains byte-deterministic across equivalent graph rebuilds.
- Full graph builds and incremental change discovery now include registered Rust `.rs` files; the packed-install smoke test covers TypeScript, Python, and Rust.

### Performance
- On the mex benchmark corpus, the median grep-top-3-to-scope estimated-output ratio was **10.74×** while `mex graph scope` retained **1.0 expected-symbol recall** across six symbol tasks.
- A five-task real-agent comparison answered all tasks correctly with both retrieval detail modes. The default `minimal` mode used targeted `graph get` expansion and required no Read/Grep fallback; `source` fell back on four of five tasks.
- These are small-N, single-repository measurements. They do not establish an end-to-end graph-vs-no-graph token-savings claim.

### Compatibility
- Existing scaffolds without grounding or `.mex/graph.db` continue to run the original filesystem and lexical checks unchanged; upgrade with `mex graph` followed by `mex graph ground`.
- Graph interfaces are source-level contribution seams, not public npm API exports.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **MCP server** — new `packages/mex-mcp` package exposes mex to AI agents over the Model Context Protocol as native tool calls: `mex_check`, `mex_log`, `mex_timeline`, `mex_heartbeat`, and `mex_read_file`. It imports the `mex-agent` public API directly (no subprocess) and returns structured JSON, so agents in Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP clients call mex as first-class tools instead of shelling out. Every tool takes an optional `projectRoot` (defaults to cwd) and `mex_read_file` is sandboxed to the `.mex/` scaffold. `mex_sync` is deferred until its structured return shape is settled. [#84](https://github.com/mex-memory/mex/pull/84) [#81](https://github.com/mex-memory/mex/issues/81)

### Changed
- README documents the MCP server, its five tools, and client (`.mcp.json`) configuration.

### Compatibility
- No changes to the published `mex-agent` package surface or the `.mex/` scaffold. `packages/mex-mcp` is not yet published to npm; build it from the repo with `npm run build --workspace mex-mcp` and point your MCP client at `packages/mex-mcp/dist/index.js`.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- **Windows AI-CLI detection and launch** — `mex sync` and `mex setup` now detect an installed AI CLI on Windows and launch it correctly. Detection used `which` (absent on Windows), so every tool reported as not installed and interactive mode silently fell back to copy-paste even when Claude Code/Codex were present; it now probes with `where` on Windows. Launch used `spawn`/`spawnSync`, which threw `ENOENT` on the `claude.cmd` wrapper; it now uses `cross-spawn`. `runToolInteractive` also no longer treats a spawn failure or timeout as a successful session. [#85](https://github.com/mex-memory/mex/issues/85)
- **Cross-platform path output and global config** — drift issue paths, heartbeat stale files, scanner entries, and event-log paths are normalized to forward slashes on Windows (new `toPosix()` boundary), fixing a `patterns/` severity check that silently misfired; global config and telemetry id now respect Windows `USERPROFILE`, with a new `MEX_HOME` override. [#78](https://github.com/mex-memory/mex/pull/78)
- **checkPaths false positives** — `checkPaths` now only validates inline code paths from `ROUTER.md`, not all scaffold files. Eliminates false `MISSING_PATH` errors from context docs, pattern files, and tool config files where backtick-wrapped strings are config values, IPs, annotation keys, or other non-path content. [#79](https://github.com/mex-memory/mex/issues/79)
- **Package version metadata guard** — the CLI validates that `package.json` contains a non-empty string `version` before reading it at runtime. [#58](https://github.com/mex-memory/mex/issues/58)

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Event log provenance/lifecycle fields** — `EventEntry` now accepts two optional, free-form string fields: `source` (where an event came from, e.g. `meeting`, `manual`, `agent`) and `status` (decision lifecycle, e.g. `decided`, `implemented`). Both are written only when provided and are preserved by `mex timeline` (including `--json`). `kind` stays a closed enum; `status` is deliberately ungated so unrecognized values are never dropped. Exposed via `appendEvent` (the in-process API) and optional `mex log --source`/`--status` flags. Entries without these fields are unchanged.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Feedback command** — `mex feedback` opens a hosted form for users to opt in to maintainer user-research calls. A quiet, dismissible one-line invite appears after a successful `check`/`sync` and in the `mex` TUI (TTY-only, shown a few times then stops). The CLI never reads or transmits an email — it only opens the URL. Hide it with `mex config set feedback off`. Kept fully separate from telemetry.
- **Anonymous telemetry** — opt-out usage counting via PostHog. Each command sends one event with only `machine_id`, `scaffold_id`, `command` name, `mex_version`, `os`, and `node_version` — no args, paths, file contents, repo names, IP, or location. Opt out with `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, `MEX_TELEMETRY=0`, or `mex config set telemetry off`. Audit the exact payload with `mex telemetry inspect`; check state with `mex telemetry status`. Telemetry is disabled automatically when running from a clone of the mex repo. See [TELEMETRY.md](TELEMETRY.md).
- **Scaffold identity** — the scaffold's `config.json` now carries a stable `scaffold_id` (UUID v4), `scaffold_name`, and nullable `origin`/`upstream`. Generated at `mex setup` and silently backfilled for existing scaffolds on the next CLI invocation. New `getScaffoldIdentity()` export on the public API.
- **broken-link drift checker** — flags Markdown links in scaffold files whose local target file does not exist.

### Changed
- README and CONTRIBUTING now list all 11 drift checkers (including `tool-config-sync`, `todo-fixme`, and `broken-link`).

## [0.3.5] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Package rename** — the npm package is now `mex-agent`; the installed binary command remains `mex`.
- **Agent memory mode** — `mex setup --mode agent-memory` creates templates for persistent-agent, homelab, OpenClaw-style, and operational-memory workspaces.
- **Heartbeat checks** — `mex heartbeat` runs lightweight scheduled health checks over optional `last_updated` frontmatter, stale context, memory cleanup metadata, and old daily memory files.
- **Scheduled heartbeat loop** — `mex watch --interval` runs heartbeat repeatedly in the foreground while preserving the existing post-commit hook behavior for plain `mex watch`.
- **Event log** — `mex log` appends notes, decisions, risks, and todos to `.mex/events/decisions.jsonl`.
- **Timeline** — `mex timeline` reads recent event entries, with `--json` for scripting.
- **Doctor command** — `mex doctor` summarizes scaffold health across drift, heartbeat, config, and events.
- **Interactive TUI** — bare `mex` and `mex tui` open an Ink terminal dashboard with drift score, heartbeat status, event activity, timeline/log actions, and a bordered action panel.
- **Shell completions** — `mex completion bash|zsh|fish` prints completion scripts.
- **Config tuning** — optional `.mex/config.json` supports staleness thresholds, heartbeat thresholds, and watch interval defaults.

### Changed
- `mex check` output is grouped by severity with clearer remediation hints.
- `mex check --json` provides a script-friendly report shape.
- Scaffold templates now include `last_updated` frontmatter guidance and a GROW loop that encourages logging rationale with `mex log`.
- Agent-memory templates frame mex as three-layer memory: state memory in scaffold files, procedural memory in patterns, and event memory in JSONL logs.
- README documents the TUI, agent-memory mode, heartbeat, config, and the OpenClaw/persistent-agent use case.

### Compatibility
- No scaffold migration is required.
- `last_updated` is optional; files without it are ignored by heartbeat staleness checks.
- `.mex/config.json` is optional; missing values use defaults.
- `.mex/events/` is created only when events are logged.
- The TUI is additive; all existing CLI commands remain available and script-friendly.

### Deferred
- Context routing command.
- Full schema migration with ids/requires fields.
- Federation / hierarchical scaffolds.
- Bidirectional state-event references.
- Dynamic domain nodes via Tree-sitter.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **Simplified install flow** — `npx promexeus setup` now offers to install globally at the end, so `mex check` and `mex sync` just work
- Users who skip global install get clear `npx promexeus` commands as the fallback
- Removed dev-dependency + package.json scripts instructions — one canonical flow, not three
- README install section rewritten: setup → global install prompt → done
- Fixed wrong package name (`mex-cli`) in post-setup instructions
- `mex commands` output cleaned up: removed shell scripts section, shows `npx promexeus` fallback

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **`mex setup` command** — npx-first install replaces git clone + bash script. One command: `npx promexeus setup`
- Bundled scaffold templates in npm package (`templates/` directory)
- Interactive tool config selection (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot)
- Project state detection: fresh, existing, or partial scaffold
- Codebase pre-scanner integration during setup
- `--dry-run` flag for setup command
- Published to npm as `promexeus`

### Fixed
- False positive `DEPENDENCY_MISSING` warnings for versioned dependencies with semver prefixes (`^`, `~`, `>=`)

### Changed
- Package renamed from `mex` to `promexeus` for npm availability
- Sync now sends all drift issues to Claude in a single session instead of one session per file — reduces token usage and eliminates repeated session restarts
- README updated: npx is now the primary install method, git clone is the alternative

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-21
